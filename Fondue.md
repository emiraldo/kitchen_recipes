* 1 clove garlic, halved
* 290ml/½ pint white wine
* 1 tsp lemon juice

* 225g/8oz gruyère cheese grated

# Method

## Make Kibbeh Dough
* Rub the inside of the fondue pot with the halves of garlic.
* Add the wine and lemon juice to the pot and heat until boiling. Lower the heat and gradually stir in the cheeses until melted, stirring all the time.
* If using kirsch, blend with the cornflour, otherwise use water. Add to the cheese mixture and cook gently until the mixture is smooth - don't let it boil or it will burn.
* Using the fondue prongs, dip the bread cubes into the cheese and serve.
