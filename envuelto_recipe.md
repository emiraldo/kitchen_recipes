Ingredients

(4-6 Cakes)

    9 fresh ears corn with the husk
    2 cups grated cheese (mozzarella, queso fresco or farmer cheese)
    2 tablespoons melted butter
    2 eggs
    2 tablespoons sugar
    1 teaspoon salt

Directions

    Remove husks and save for wrapping.
    Cut the corn kernels off the cob. Place the corn, butter, eggs, sugar, salt and 1 cup of cheese in a food processor. Mix until smooth consistency.
    For each cake arrange 2 corn husks on a work surface. Divide the corn mixture evenly and place in the center of the husks.
    Roll the corn husks so that the filling is completely enclosed. Twist and tie the ends.
    Have a pot with water ready for steaming. Steam the cakes, covered, in a basket for 1 hour.
    Serve with grated cheese on top.
