# Cayeye

## Ingredients


- Water
- 1/2 tablespoon salt
- 3 green bananas
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- Coastal cheese to taste
- 2 butter spoons

# Steps to Make It

1. In a medium saucepan we heat plenty of water with half a tablespoon of salt. Meanwhile, we wash the bananas and peel them. If you have never peeled green bananas, start by removing tips and make a cut along the peel, the cut should be deep, but it should not reach the pulp because the banana would split. With the help of the knife the bark is lifted and with the fingers they finish separating it from the pulp. Put the bananas in the boiling water, add a tablespoon of vinegar and cover the pot. We let the bananas cook until they are soft.

2. Grate a piece of coastal cheese, I recognize that I like cayeye with a lot of cheese hehe ... Once the bananas are soft, we take them out of the pot and we crush them with a fork. We add cheese to taste and a few tablespoons of the cooking water, crush the bananas well and make sure that the cayeye feels soft and light. Add the butter and a little more cheese on the mash. We serve immediately. The puree should be eaten immediately, if we leave it for a long time, it becomes heavy and compact.

3. Enjoy!
