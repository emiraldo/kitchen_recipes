# Cayeye

## Ingredients


- 2 medium potatoes per person.
- 3 sausages per person, frankfurt type but not too thin. Oscar Mayer's Classic Wieners are doing great.
- 200 grams of fine grated cheese, I put gouda.
- 1 large cooked breast and then separated into strands.
- Onion minced very small. * I have not put *
- ketchup sauce, I used industrial.
- Pink sauce (but not the one we know).
- pineapple sauce
 -Salt

# Steps to Make It

1. Peel, cut into strips and fry the potatoes in plenty of oil, until golden brown and crispy.
2. Cut each sausage into multiple equal pieces.
3. We cook the breast and still warm it, we will remove it, if you want to finish quickly make this step with two forks. Take one in each hand and a piece of breast on the plate, start pulling the breast in opposite directions, as if they were fighting and the meat will be undone quickly and without problems.
4. Grate the cheese. If it is very creamy and you have trouble handling it, you can freeze it while doing all the previous steps. Then it will be easier to scratch it.
5. Serve the ingredients to taste in a bowl.
6. Enjoy!
